Terraform - IaC - Server + AMI + region

Ansible - Install Qlik Replicate from Vendor on IaC, configure it,
then create params for each user env.

I would like you to complete Qlik Replicate install coding without source configuration as an initial deliverable. 

I would like you to come up with a code that reads a config file with parameters needed for source configuration.

The target for Qlik Replicate is Databricks Delta Lake so we need parameter driven target configuration as well. The values will change from Dev->Test->Integration->Stage->Prod
